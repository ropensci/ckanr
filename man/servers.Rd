CKAN server URLS and other info
}
\details{
Comes from the links at https://ckan.org/about/instances/

There were a number of other URLs for CKAN instances in the CKAN URL
above, but some sites are now gone completely, or if they do exist,
I can't figure out how to get access to the CKAN API on their instance.

# what version is each CKAN server running
out <- lapply(servers()[1:6], function(w) {
  cat(w, sep='\n') 
  ckan_info(w)

vapply(out, "[[", "", "ckan_version")
