ckanr 0.6.0
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* parameter `http_method` gained in `resource_create()`, `package_update()`, and `package_patch()`; it's passed to `as.ckan_package()` internally, but does not affect the HTTP request for the main point of the function (#163) thanks @hannaboe
* gains new function `organization_purge()` to purge an organization (which requires sysadmin) (#166) thanks @nicholsn

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* update URLs for known CKAN instances behind the `servers()` function (#162) (#167) (#170)
* .Rbuildignore README.md and vignettes (#171)
* `extras` now passed in HTTP request in `package_create()` as a top level part of the request body rather than as a named `extras` element (#158) thanks @galaH
* change in `ckan_fetch()`: now when a zip file has a subdirectory an `NA` is returned rather than `character(0)` (#164)
* change in the `...` parameter in `ckan_fetch()`: was used to pass through curl options to the http request but now is used to pass through additional parameters to either `read.csv`, `xml2::read_xml`, `jsonlite::fromJSON`, `sf::st_read()`, `read.table()`, or `readxl::read_excel` (#165)
* updated docs for `package_create()` and `group_create()` - change `groups` parameter description to explain what kind of input is expected (#168)


ckanr 0.5.0
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* `package_create()` gains parameter `private` (boolean) (#145)
* add support for resource extras. `resource_create()` and `resource_update()` gain new parameter `extras`, while `resource_patch()` function doesn't change but gains an example of adding an extra (#149) (#150) thanks @nicholsn
* `package_patch()` gains `extras` parameter (#94) see also (#147)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* replace httr with crul throughout package (#86) (#151)
* use markdown for docs (#148)
* `package_patch()`, `package_show()`, `package_activity_list()`, `package_delete()`, `package_update()`, and `related_create()` now pass on `key` parameter value to `as.ckan_package` internally; same for `resource_create()` and `resource_show()`, but passed to `as.ckan_resource()`  (#145) (#146)
* `servers()` gains two additional CKAN urls (#155)
* `package_show()` called `as.ckan_package()` within it, which itself calls `package_show()` - fixed now  (#127)

### BUG FIXES

* fix for `resource_search()` and `tag_search`: both were not allowing a query to be more than length 1 (#153)
* fix for `print.ckan_package`: wasn't handling well results from `package_search()` that had a named list of locale specific results (#152)


ckanr 0.4.0
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* `ckan_fetch()` gains parameter `key` for a CKAN API key; if given the API key is now included in the request headers (#133) see also (#122) by @sharlagelfand
* `ckan_fetch()` gains ability to read xls/xlsx files with multiple sheets (#135) by @sharlagelfand

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `ckan_fetch()` now sets `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when reading data (#141) (#142) thanks @LVG77 @sharlagelfand
* in `ckan_fetch()`, use `basename(x)` instead of `gsub(paste0(tempdir(), "/"), "", x)`, to get file path (#140) by @sharlagelfand
* in `package_search()` handle better cases where the CKAN version can not be determined (#139) && fix logic for when `default_schema` and `include_private` parameters are included based on the CKAN version (#137) by @sharlagelfand
* improve `ckan_fetch()`: old behavior of the fxn with zip files was that it only worked if the zip file contained shp files; works more generally now, e.g., a zip file containing a csv file (#132) by @sharlagelfand
* fix `ckan_fetch()` examples that weren't working (#134) by @sharlagelfand
* fix to parsing CKAN version numbers, new internal fxn `parse_version_number()` - now properly parses CKAN version numbers that include patch and dev versions (#136) by @sharlagelfand


ckanr 0.3.0
===========

### NEW FEATURES

* new package author Sharla Gelfand !!!
* new functions for users: `user_create()` and `user_delete()` (#82)

* function `fetch()` changed to `ckan_fetch()`
* gains function `organization_delet()` to delete an organization (#83)
* gains function `ckan_version()` to get version info for a CKAN instance

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* fix some tests (#62)
* fix to `ds_create()` to properly format body with json data (#85) thanks @mattfullerton
* tests added for `ckan_fetch()` (#118) thanks @sharlagelfand
* `ckan_fetch()` gains `format` parameter if the user knows the file format (useful when the file format can not be guessed) (#117) thanks @sharlagelfand
* `ckan_fetch` gain support for handling geojson (#123) thanks @sharlagelfand
* `ckan_fetch` was writing to current working directory in some cases - fixed to writing to temp files and cleaning up (#125) (#128) (#129) thanks @sharlagelfand
* add USDA CKAN instance to the `servers()` function (#68)
* `ds_create_dataset()` marked as deprecated; see `recourse_create()` instead (#80) (via #79)
* removed the internal `stop()` call in `tag_create()`: now can be used, though haven't been able to test this function as you need to be a sysadmin to use it (#81)
* `ds_search()`: code spacing fixes (#69)
* `resource_update()` gains more examples and tests (#66)
* CKAN API key standardization: `key` parameter now in all fxns that make http requests - and reordering of `url` and `key` params in that order across all functions (#122) (#124)
* repair ORCID links in DESCRIPTION file (#124) by Florian

### BUG FIXES

* fix to `resource_create()`: `upload` param was inappropriately a required param (#75) thanks @mingbogo
* fixes to `resource_update()`: date sent in `last_modified` in request body needed to be converted to character (#96) (thanks @jasonajones73); and the date format needed fixing (#119) (thanks @florianm)
* fix to `ckan_fetch()` - use `sf` instead of `maptools`; in addition `ckan_fetch` can now parse xlsx files in addition to xls files;  (#114) (#115) thanks @sharlagelfand
* fix to `package_search()`: this route fails if parameters that did not exist in the CKAN instance are given; internally remove parameters as needed from query params by pinging the CKAN instance for its version (#120)
